# Getting Started with call-T1-api

This is a simple project that was created as part of a training course from [T1 Holding](https://t1.ru/).\
The application uses several REST APIs to allow you to register as an training course participant and set your recording status.

# Step-by-step installation:

1. Check for node.js on your PC by using `node -v` command. If you have't installed `node v20.9.0` before, then install it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager?ref=molify.net).
2. Run the `npm install` command in the cloned project folder to install node modules.
3. Execute one of the [available scripts](#available-scripts).

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
